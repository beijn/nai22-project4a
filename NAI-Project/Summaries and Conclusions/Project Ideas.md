## Latent knobs

If music is represented as a latent graph (even just a linear one (= sequence), or a single vector), one should be able to tune those values to excert meaning full human control ([Akten, Memo, 2021](zotero://select/library/items/9JA727P7)). A single vector with hundreds of dimensions is incomprehensible and thus meaningful human control becomes very difficult. Encouraging the latent representations to be disentangled could (maybe) be a prerequisite for a human to understand the controls by associating discrete concepts with each dimension. Partitioning

A project could explore whether disentangling of latent vectors makes a difference in the likeliness of understandable concepts emerging. As well as the merits of distributing the code among multiple lower dimensional vectors for example per structural unit of a piece.
