## Bayes’ Theorem
![[Bayes.svg]]

$P(H|E)=\frac{P(H\cap E)}{P(E)}=\frac{Both}{\text{Evidence}}=\frac{P(E|H)\ P(H)}{P(E)}=\frac{\text{Likelihood}\ \cdot\ \text{Prior}}{\text{Evidence}}$

## Idea
Alternative / complementary formulations:
- The known probability of some hypothesis $H$ can be informed *a posteriori* by the probability of some related evidence $E$ and the knowledge of its happening. 
- The presence of some evidence $E$ restricts the possible worlds with respect to an hypothesis $H$ and one should know how. 
- The $P$robability of $H$aving corona g$|$ven a positive t$E$st is the probability of both in co$\cap$junction dev$/$ded by the probability of seeing the $E$vidence at all (without respect to any other information), devided since we know we live in one of the worlds where the evidence occurs. 
- From all the possible worlds where the $E$vidence occurs (no matter if its intended implications hold or not) we zoom in on the subset in which the $H$ypothesis holds as well. This subset of worlds in which $H$ypothesis a$\cap$d $E$vidence are given is as probable as \[the *Likelihood* of having the evidence *cond$|$tioned* on the holding of the hypothesis] a$\times$d the holding of the $H$ypothesis in general (*prior* to consideration of evidence). 
- $H$aving corona a$\cap$d a positive t$E$st is \[to have a positive test dur$|$ng having corona] a$\times$d having corona *prior* to knowing Bayes. 
- $E$vident that it was sunny y$E$sterday makes it more probable to have sunshine $H$eute *a posteriori* as well, than it would be *prior* to knowing y$E$sterdays weather, considering that $H$eute’s weather also has something to say about the likelihood of its caus$E$.
